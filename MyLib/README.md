# Matrix

//To create a matrix of any size or type:

Matrix<type,number of rows, number of columns> matrixname;

//Initilizes values to 0 when created but values can be added through the following methods:

Matrix<int,2,3> myMatrix; myMatrix={1,2,3,4,5,6};

// or individually

myMatrix(1,1)= 1; myMatrix(1,2)= 2;

// The values of one matrix can also be assignned to another as long as the number of rows and columns as equal Matrix myMatrix; myMatrix={1,2,3,4,5,6};

Matrix<int,2,3> newMatrix;

newMatrix = myMatrix;
